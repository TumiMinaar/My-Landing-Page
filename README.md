My Landing Page:

Is my 1st published on github project where I share my code 
with the public. The whole idea is to show my coding pattern 
on a simple project, my home personal website. 

The first page; index.html 
is more geard towards it being my digital business card like appearance, 
and my 2nd page is more the back-side and shows what I will be building
on and the title I go by when doing my projects.

I used languages; HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap in order 
to showcase, and still will be updating the side on incremental basis towards
its finished product.

I'm constantly learning as I go along.
